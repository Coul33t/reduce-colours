# reduce-colours

This algorithm allows you to reduce the number of colours inside an original image to a desired number of colours (*n*).

### Libraries used:
  * Skimage (Scikit image)
  * OpenCV (unusued right now)
  * PIL
  * Numpy
  * Libtcod (unused right now)

### DONE:
 * GUI
 
### TODO: 
 * Colour picker in the generated list
 * Args parser (input image and *n*)
 * Allow to specify regions to exclude for the colour reduction
 * Continue developping the other method
 * Initial and final colours display in terminal with libtcod
