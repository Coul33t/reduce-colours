# reduce-colours

This algorithm allows you to reduce the number of colours inside an original image to a desired number of colours (*n*).

### Libraries used:
  * Skimage (Scikit image)
  * OpenCV (unusued right now)
  * PIL
  * Numpy
  * Libtcod (unused right now)
  
### TODO:  
 * Args parser (input image and *n*)
 * GUI (selection of colours, colour picker, etc.)
 * Continue developping the other method
 * Initial and final colours display in terminal with libtcod
